    <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is my first GitHub repo and I'm so excited! :-) 
    <h2> It's not my first time writing code though.</h2>

    <p>In fact, I am quite proficient in HTML, so I shall show off shan't I? </p>
    <hr>
    <h2> The Story.</h2>
    <p> I am a product manager and some of the reason I am doing this are... <p> 
        <ul>
            <li> I'm a Product Manager.</li>
        <li>I'm founding a startup.</li>
        <li>The world is going tech and I can't be left behind.</li>
        </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Where, How, and Why It Gets Interesting.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm just gonna attached an image here, just because I can</p>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1600/1*wIS1i_m51Ku8ZShDm9yHhA.jpeg">
    <ol> <p>Now with that's settled, let's create some more lists:</p>
        <li>I love the soft, lavish lifestyle. </li>
        <li>Making impact and helping people is my core.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The image has just ruined the entire look of the page, but I don't know enough HTML to adjust it.</p>
    <p>I need to learn the technical aspects of everything else, I will be done before I even start.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Why though?</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li><b><em>Idea Theft</em></b> is the major reason.</li>
        <li>However, there's also <b><em>Naivety,</em></b> which I have heard is a disease.</li>
        <li>Then, there is <b><em>Missing out on Opportunities,</em></b> just becauseI don't know enough or have enough to leverage them.</li>
        <hr>
        <p>I <b>NEVER</b> want to be in any of those positions. <br> This is because it is disadvantageous at best and doesn't offer ant benefit at all.</p>
        <p>In everything I do, what Icanot afford is not knowing what goes on, as well as what is expected to happen.</p>
        <p>This is because knowing also means that I can push my team to work harder and they won't object because they know that I can do what they do... <br> And if they don't do what I ask, I can always get someone to do it or jump on it myself, which means they lose their jobs.</p>
        <p>However, I do not want to lay off my staff for a reason as <em>ignorable</em> as that.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>I believe in having a team I trust and believe in, as well as a team that believes and trust in me without fail and I will not have one without the other.</p>
        <p>For me, it's a complete package that I have to leverage.</p>
        <p>I may not always get it right or know what to do. However, I will try my best to move/act quickly and with wisdom.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Mighty Hand of God.</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In so doing, I <b>MUST</b> not belittle the majesty of God.</p>
        <p>HE is king above all things, even me and my desires. Thanks to him, I have dominion over my flesh and it's desires.</p>
        <p>I reach heights that only legends reach. There are many legends already, but I create a new standard of achievments that they have not yet attained.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Right now, this is just talk. I have to show workingssss...</p>
        <p>Without workings, every plan and though is useless... utterly.</p>
        <p>I cannot be useless or have my plans fail and dissapoint people because I don't wnat to do work.</p>
        <p>I see myself as a self-motivated person who relies on God and I act smart and fast, and get the bets results.</p>
        <p>And now that I have "mastered" HTML, it's time to jump on CSS.</p>
        <p>I have till November 30th, 2024 exactly 20 days from now to master it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Goodbyes.</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>Let's see what I'm able to do yeah?</p>
        <p>Bye for now. [wave]</p>
